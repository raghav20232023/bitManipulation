# bitManipulation

 Implementation of Bit Manipulation operations like clearBit, getBit, setBit, updateBit in command line interface. 

 Note: I strongly suggest the reader to refer to the in code comments if they get stuck anywhere. In the code, necessary comments are written at all the places where someone reading the code might get stuck. All login flow and formulae/implementation is also explained via comments inside the code itself :). The comments will clear all of your doubts.

I would also like to mention that at the same time I have put considerable effort in making sure the code is as clean and readable as possible, and all the variable names are written in English language pertaining to the function they perform.

**1.clearBit :**

To clear the bit in a number input by the user at a given position (also input by the user).
Remember, both the input and output is a decimal number.
